# c-exp
!Notice: This algorithm is under test, not sure if a home computer has the ability to compile it without crashing.

This algorithm prints mathematical expressions made by {1, 2, 3, ..., 9, -, +} - in an ascending order (<b>NOT</b> <del>1 + 2 - 5 + 6 +79 - 843</del>)
and obviously using each number just once - that equal to 100 (e.g. 123 - 45 - 67 + 89 = 100).

I'd be so happy if you help me improving this algorithm by forking or opening issues. Good algorithm for beginners to practice programming.
